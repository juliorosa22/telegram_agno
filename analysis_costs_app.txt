Of course. This is a critical business question, and it's smart to analyze costs before setting a price. Let's break down the estimated monthly LLM costs and then discuss a pricing strategy.

Analysis of LLM API Calls and Costs
First, let's identify every point in your application that makes an LLM API call and estimate its token usage.

Pricing Assumptions (as of late 2025):

Groq Llama 3.1 70B: Extremely fast and cost-effective for text.
Input: ~$0.59 / 1 million tokens
Output: ~$0.79 / 1 million tokens
Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (Vision): Excellent for multimodal tasks (images/PDFs).
Input (Text): ~$0.35 / 1 million tokens
Input (Image): ~$2.50 / 1,000 images (assuming standard resolution)
Input (PDF): ~$1.00 / 1,000 pages
Output: ~$1.05 / 1 million tokens
Token Estimation:

1,000 tokens is roughly 750 words.
Your Prompts: Your agent instructions are quite detailed. The TransactionAgent prompt is about 500 tokens, and the MainAgent prompt is about 200 tokens.
Cost Breakdown per Action:
Message Routing (route_message in main_agent.py)

Model: Groq Llama 3.1 70B
Input: ~200 tokens (instructions) + ~50 tokens (user message) = 250 tokens
Output: ~30 tokens (classification)
Cost: ~$0.00016 per message. This is extremely cheap.
Text Transaction (process_message in transaction_agent.py)

Model: Groq Llama 3.1 70B
Input: ~500 tokens (instructions) + ~50 tokens (user message) = 550 tokens
Output: ~100 tokens (JSON object)
Cost: ~$0.00040 per transaction. Also very cheap.
Receipt Photo Processing (process_receipt_image)

Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash
Input: 1 image (<del>$0.0025) + ~200 tokens of text instructions (</del>$0.00007) = ~$0.00257
Output: <del>100 tokens (JSON object) = **</del>$0.00010**
Total Cost: ~$0.0027 per receipt. This is ~7x more expensive than a text transaction.
Bank Statement PDF Processing (process_bank_statement)

Model: Gemini 1.5 Flash
Input: Let's assume a 3-page PDF. 3 pages * $0.001/page = $0.003. Text instructions are negligible.
Output: Let's say it extracts 30 transactions, <del>2,000 tokens of JSON. **</del>$0.0021**
Total Cost: ~$0.0051 per 3-page statement. This is your most expensive operation per-item.
General Chit-Chat (Fallback in main_agent.py)

Model: Groq Llama 3.1 70B
Input: ~200 tokens (instructions) + ~50 tokens (user message) = 250 tokens
Output: ~100 tokens (conversational reply)
Cost: ~$0.00022 per message.
On Truncating User Messages in route_message
Your idea to truncate the user message is a good instinct for cost control, but in this specific case, it's unnecessary and potentially harmful.

Why it's unnecessary: The cost of text processing with Groq is so low (fractions of a cent) that even a very long user message of 1,000 tokens would only cost about $0.0005. The savings from truncation are negligible.
Why it's harmful: If you truncate a message like "I just spent $25.50 on a birthday gift for my mom at the new mall," you might cut off the context ("new mall") or the amount, leading to failed extractions and a frustrated user.
Recommendation: Do not truncate text messages. The cost is minimal, and the risk of degrading performance is high. Focus your cost control on the expensive items: images and PDFs.

Overall Cost Estimate per User (Monthly)
Let's create three user personas to estimate monthly costs.

1. The "Light" User
60 text transactions/reminders (60 * $0.00040 = $0.024)
5 receipt photos (5 * $0.0027 = $0.0135)
20 general chats (20 * $0.00022 = $0.0044)
Total Monthly LLM Cost: ~$0.04
2. The "Medium" User
150 text transactions/reminders (150 * $0.00040 = $0.06)
20 receipt photos (20 * $0.0027 = $0.054)
1 bank statement PDF (1 * $0.0051 = $0.0051)
50 general chats (50 * $0.00022 = $0.011)
Total Monthly LLM Cost: ~$0.13
3. The "Power" User
300 text transactions/reminders (300 * $0.00040 = $0.12)
50 receipt photos (50 * $0.0027 = $0.135)
4 bank statement PDFs (4 * $0.0051 = $0.0204)
100 general chats (100 * $0.00022 = $0.022)
Total Monthly LLM Cost: ~$0.30
Observation: Even for a power user, your direct LLM costs are very low, likely under $0.50 per month. This is a huge advantage of using highly optimized models like Groq and Gemini Flash.

Pricing Strategy for a Good Profit Margin
Your costs aren't just the LLM APIs. You must also factor in:

Database/Server Hosting: Supabase's free tier is generous, but a production app might need a paid plan (~$25/month).
Your Development Time: The most valuable asset.
Marketing & Support Costs.
Payment Processing Fees: PayPal takes ~3.5% + a fixed fee.
Given your low variable costs, you can be very competitive.

Recommended Pricing Model:

Freemium Tier (Your Current Model):

Offer a limited number of credits per month (e.g., 100 credits).
Cost Allocation: 1 credit per text, 5 credits per receipt, 10 credits per PDF. This aligns the credit cost with the actual dollar cost.
This is a great way to let users try the service and see its value.
Premium Tier: $4.99 / month or $49.99 / year

Why this price? It's a standard "coffee-a-month" price point for a high-utility consumer app. It's low enough to be an impulse purchase but high enough to be a sustainable business.
Profit Margin:
Revenue: $4.99
PayPal Fee: ~$0.30
Power User LLM Cost: ~$0.30
Profit per User (before hosting/dev time): ~$4.39
This gives you a ~90% gross margin on your variable costs, which is excellent. It provides plenty of room to cover your fixed costs (hosting, etc.) and, most importantly, to pay yourself for your work.
Conclusion: Your app is very cost-efficient. You can confidently offer a generous free tier to attract users and a premium plan around $4.99/month that provides significant value to users while ensuring a healthy profit margin for your business
