Step-by-Step Deployment Plan
Containerize Your Application: Create a Dockerfile for your project. This file tells Google Cloud how to build a container image of your application, including installing dependencies from requirements.txt.

Push the Container to Artifact Registry: Build your container image and push it to Google's private container registry.

Deploy to Cloud Run:

Create a new Cloud Run service and select the container image you just pushed.
Crucially, for Ingress (networking), select "Allow internal traffic and traffic from Cloud Load Balancing." This prevents the public from accessing your service directly over unencrypted HTTP.
Configure all your environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, STRIPE_API_KEY, etc.) in the Cloud Run settings.
Set up the External HTTPS Load Balancer:

Go to the Load Balancing section in the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new "External HTTPS Load Balancer."
Frontend Configuration: This is the public-facing part. You'll create a forwarding rule, reserve a static IP address, and create a Google-managed SSL certificate for your domain (e.g., api.yourdomain.com). Google handles the creation and renewal of this certificate for free.
Backend Configuration: For the backend, you will select "Cloud Run" and point it to the service you created in the previous step.
Update Your DNS: Point your domain's A record (e.g., api.yourdomain.com) to the static IP address you reserved for the load balancer.

Update Stripe Webhook URL: In your Stripe Dashboard, update the webhook endpoint to your new, live, HTTPS URL: https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1/webhooks/stripe.
